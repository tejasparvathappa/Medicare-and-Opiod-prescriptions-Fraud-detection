# Medicare-and-Opiod-prescriptions-Fraud-detection

## The Medicare Fraud Detection model utilizes open data to identify and predict fraudulent Medicare providers by analyzing fraud patterns, anomaly detection, and geo-demographic metrics. Additionally, with the aid of FDA drug data, the model aims to detect fraud related to opiate prescriptions and overdoses. All datasets used in this model are derived from publicly available sources such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), FDA/openFDA, and other open data resources.
